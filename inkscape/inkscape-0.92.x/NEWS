Inkscape 0.92.4 is a stability and bugfix release. It also brings some
notable performance improvements for filter rendering, measure tool,
extensions, document saving and moving paths (with a live path effect)
and includes a couple of small, but impactful usage improvements.

Important Changes
=================

This Inkscape version will not work with Windows XP anymore. Inkscape
0.92.3 is the last version that works on XP.

Align and Distribute
====================

You can now align multiple (ungrouped) objects as a group relative to
another, single object.

This makes "treat selection as group" useful with the selections "Last
selected / First selected / Biggest object / Smallest object" in which
case all elements will be moved as a group relative to the "focused"
element which will be kept fixed.

Example aligning multiple (ungrouped) objects to first selected object:

Color sliders
=============

The movement of the color sliders can now be constrained by holding the "Ctrl"
key while dragging.

(step size is 16 if the max value is 255, and 10 if the max is 100)

Extensions
==========

  • Previously, the current selection was lost after running an extension. Now,
    whenever possible, Inkscape will try to keep the objects selected.
  • Extensions developers can again rely on the order of
    inkex.Effect.selected.iteritems() reflecting the user's selection order
    properly.
  • Extensions work faster now in documents consisting of a large number of
    objects. [To be confirmed.]

Automated Graphics Processing
=============================

Inkscape is now able to read and write pipes. You can use this to process data
without using temporary files.

You can read from standard input:

 cat vector.svg | inkscape --file - --export-png img.png

You can write image data to standard output and directly convert to JPEG (using
ImageMagick's 'convert' command):

 inkscape --file vector.svg --export-png - | convert - out.jpg

Also a full processing chain is possible by reading and writing to pipes:

 cat vector.svg | inkscape --file - --export-png - | convert - out.jpg

Other improvements
==================

  • Improved saving speed (especially some extreme slowdowns with certain large
    files like those created by Adobe Illustrator have been resolved, see also
    bug #1793877)
  • Improved filter rendering speed (Commit)
  • Improved performance of the measure tool, when grids are visible (Commit)
  • Dragging paths with a live path effect works faster now (Bug #245078)

Regression fixes
================

  • Deselecting a path with many nodes would take a long time (Bugs #1652100
    and #1745763)
  • Ungrouping text elements would result in a changed font size. (Bug #1733651
    )
  • Some files with live path effects that could not be opened in Inkscape
    0.92.3 work again in 0.92.4 (Bug #1769679)

Notable bugfixes
================

  • Some printer drivers (reportedly Canon, EPSON, and Konica Minolta drivers)
    either failed to print at all, or scaled documents to the wrong paper size.
    Inkscape would send print jobs with a custom paper size, instead of sizes
    supported by the drivers. (Bug #630635 comments 3-7; bug #1289733; GitLab
    MRs 258 and 259)
  • The measure tool became confused by mirrored text. Now it measures
    distances between letters correctly, even when mirrored. (Bug #1738504)
  • Fixed reduced opacity of partially transparent embedded bitmap images in
    PDF export. (Bug #381677)
  • Fixed reduced opacity of partially transparent filtered objects in PDF
    export when "Rasterize filter effects" is active. (Bug #381677)
  • Fixed a very annoying crash when Shift/Ctrl-clicking on control handles of
    shapes. (Bug #1594877)
  • Inkscape can now be built with up-to-date poppler library 0.72.0. This is
    especially useful for Mac OS users, using Homebrew for building Inkscape. (
    Commit)
  • Filter editor no longer crashes when removing the last blend filter (Bug #
    1795847)
  • Fixed a crash upon closing a document, when the default template was
    missing (Commit)
  • Copy-pasting the power stroke LPE from one path to another works better now
    (Bug #1005036)

More bug fixes
==============

There were even more issues fixed than those listed above, but these probably
only affect a small portion of users, or are relevant for development and
packaging only.
